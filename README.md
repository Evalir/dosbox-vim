# dosbox-vim

Hey there! Have you ever felt nostalgia for the old MS-DOS Editor, which as of windows 10 is gone? Well, I kind of do sometimes (Even though I'm 18), but I made a quick syntax scheme for VIM that gives that old school vibe. Combined with things such as the IBM PC fonts, and the operator-highlight plugin by valloric, it can really get you back to that old school vibe.

#Installation

-Download repository

-Get .vim files out to downloads folder

-Open terminal and execute this command 
`mv ~/Downloads/vim-distinguished-develop/colors/*.vim ~/.vim/colors/`

-Reopen VIM and do `:colorscheme dosbox`


#Screenshots

-> Font used: "IBM BIOS-2y"
-> Operators highlighted with valloric's operator highlight plugin.
